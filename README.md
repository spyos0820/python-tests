# python-tests
I'm learning to code and work with python.
These are the first lines of code i wrote on my own especially main.py is written without inspiration and purely with the knowledge i got from w3schools.com
main2.py and main3.py are based on main.py but optimised by myself and sometimes a little help of chat-gpt ot the internet.
They are in chronological order being each a newer optimised version of the previous one, the gpt one is a version optimised by chat-gpt.
I'm aware that this is probably not the best or most efficient way of coding but I'm always open to receive suggestions, advice, tips, etc.
13/09/2025: changes: 
-fixed bugs
-added a version with tkinter for style and to be able to play it in a difffrent window 
-focused on the number game in number-game.py to optimise and add some functions: higher/lower.
