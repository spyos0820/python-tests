# python-tests
I'm learning to code and work with python.
These are the first lines of code i wrote on my own especially main.py is written without inspiration and purely with the knowledge i got from w3schools.com
main2.py and main3.py are based on main.py but optimised by myself and sometimes a little help of chat-gpt ot the internet.
They are in chronological order being each a newer optimised version of the previous one, the gpt one is a version optimised by chat-gpt.
